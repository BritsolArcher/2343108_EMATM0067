    "\n",
    "### Setting up your environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using ```conda``` to create an environment with the correct versions of all the packages you need for these labs. You can install either Anaconda or Miniconda, which will include the ```conda``` program. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a .yml file that lists all the packages you will need, and the versions that we have tested the labs with. You can use this file to create your environment as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal. Use the command line to navigate to the directory containing this notebook and the file ```crossplatform_environment.yml```. You can use the command ```cd``` to change directory on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the conda program by typing ```conda env create -f crossplatform_environment.yml```, then answer any questions that appear on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Activate the environment by running the command ```conda activate text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make kernel available in Jupyter: ```python -m ipykernel install --user --name=text_analytics```.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relaunch Jupyter: shutdown any running instances, and then type ```jupyter lab``` into your command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find this notebook and open it up again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go to the top menu and change the kernel: click on 'Kernel'--> 'Change kernel' --> text_analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now be ready to go!\n",
    "\n",
    "The core libraries we will be using in this unit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/), produced by HuggingFace, is a hub for lots of interesting text datasets.\n",
    "- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org), a comprehensive NLP library.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), for machine learning and classifier evaluation.\n",
    "- [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), for topic modelling.\n",
    "- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index), for state-of-the-art NLP models. \n",
    "- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), a framework for deep learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "The libraries above have good documentation, which is available either online (links above) or via Python itself, e.g. `help(numpy.array)` in the Python interpreter. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Refreshers for Python and Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skip this part if you're already familiar with Python and Jupyter notebooks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab assumes you have used Python and Jupyter Notebooks before. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an introduction or refresher on Python, see the [Introduction to Python lab](https://github.com/UoB-COMS21202/lab_sheets_public/tree/master/lab_1) or the University of Bristol [Beginning Python](https://milliams.gitlab.io/beginning_python/) course. If you are a beginner with Python, you might also like to look at Chapter 1 in the NLTK book, which also provides a guide for \"getting started with Python\": https://www.nltk.org/book/ \n",
    "\n",
    "The labs will be run on [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/), an interactive coding environment embedded in a webpage supporting various programing languages (Python, R, Lua, etc.) through the concept of kernels.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It allows you to enrich your code with complex comments formatted in Markdown and $\\LaTeX$, as well as to place the results of your computation right below your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are organised in cells which can contain either code (in our case, this will be Python code) or text, which can be easily and nicely formatted using the Markdown notation. \n",
    "\n",
    "To edit an already existing cell simply double-click on it. You can use the toolbar to insert new cells, edit and delete them (or use keyboard shortcuts which are very handy to speed up coding). \n",
    "\n",
    "Cells can be run by hitting `shift+enter` when editing a cell or by clicking on the `Run` button at the top. Running a Markdown cell will simply display the formatted text, while running a code cell will execute the commands executed in it. Create new cells with the keyboard shortcut `esc` followed by `A` or `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: when you run a code cell, all the created variables, implemented functions and imported libraries will be then available to every other code cell. It is commonly assumed that cells will be run in the correct sequence and running them repeatedly or out-of-order may sometimes cause errors. To reset all variables and functions (for debugging) simply click `Kernel > Restart` from the Jupyter menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells allow you to write fancy and simple comments: all of this is written in Markdown - double click on this cell to see the source. An introduction to Markdown syntax can be found [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).\n",
    "\n",
    "As Markdown is translated to HTML upon displaying it also allows you to use pure HTML: more details are available [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you can also display simple $\\LaTeX$ equations in Markdown thanks to `MathJax` support. For inline equations wrap your equation between `$` symbols; for display mode equations use `$$`."

Every scene is designed and decorated to immaculate detail. The extravagant costumes, lavish locations and beautifully landscaped gardens all make \"The Young Victoria\" very impressive. I was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography. How every person is placed in relation to the background or foreground is well thought out, every scene is well composed. The scene that strikes me the most was when Victoria talks to Melbourne. Melbourne was positioned in the middle of the door frame from Victoria\\'s angle, while from Melbourne\\'s angle Victoria was situated between the space where Melbourne held his arm on his hips.<br /><br />Story wise, it is far too compressed to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of Queen Victoria. Many events are rushed through or not even explained. I expected a grand scene of the coronation, and disappointingly it only lasted for a few seconds.<br /><br />Overall, \"The Young Victoria\" is a good film, and it would have been even better if it was longer, so that events could be properly explained without rush.',\n",

Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title - \"Seinfeld\". What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of \"humor\", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, \"the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized\", on the \"Dick Van Dyke Show\", or \"the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory.\" In other words, it\\'s an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. That the writers and producers of \"Friends\" would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyone\\'s even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers.<br /><br />You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake Up. These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow manage to live in $4000/mo. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that.

There\\'s nothing classic or monumental about this--it\\'s just a quick, gleefully dirty little film that\\'s lots of fun. It only falls apart at the end with a little \"moral\" ending that the censors demanded.

This version was thought to be lost until 2004 when it was discovered by mistake! I believe this is the only one in release--but be aware. <br /><br />The acting is good--Stanwyck jumps into her role and plays it WAY over the top.

He dies of cancer, yet it's figured out how to bring him back: put his brain into a donor body. The mad doctor in charge (Kent Taylor) puts it in a highly unlikely body: the facially scarred giant manservant named Gor (John Bloom). A doctor friend of the ruler tries to remedy matters and put an end to the mad doctors' plans.<br /><br />Film-making partners Samuel M. Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) corral several actors they've worked with before, including Taylor, Adamsons' sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov, and Vicki Volante. They tried to go for the feel of the previous \"Blood Island\" entries but one can tell this was made stateside. While not necessarily a \"good\" film, it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole. A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually pretty coherent, with plot twists thrown in here and there. I think it could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes drag. But it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect.<br /><br />For this kind of thing, the acting isn't too bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role. Volante is appealing enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any event, it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy B \"horror\" (I use the word loosely, none of this is exactly scary) film, it certainly amuses.<br /><br />7/10; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: \"Love Life\" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance, and all-too-often acting chops to match. Many times, the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a fine job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me, since I was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: At the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and it was at the police ballistics lab. <br /><br />But where did the gun under the hood, used in the demonstration, come from? Wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did Columbo's cops replicate the camera/gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do that without breaking and entering the car? Perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo have replicated their camera/gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob? Columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it re-planted under the hood of the car, and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting.<br /><br />This was a 10/10 show until this glaring plot error at the end.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this \"Smile\" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.<br /><br />The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a TV-spawned Malibu family act out \"Gidget Get Birth Control.\" Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.<br /><br />The film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating Ling like the Frankenstein monster. Kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and Kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. Why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? We see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is Ling being equally as hot and popular as Katie.<br /><br />Funding for the film came from a trust established by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They envisioned a heritage of quality family films. Give me \"Son of Paleface\" any day.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: Alright, let me break it down for ya... Haggard is probably one of the funniest pointless movies you'll ever see. It's got a mixture of a unique storyline about a guy having girl troubles and everything going backwards for him mixed in with countless humorous scenes that will keep you laughing throughout the whole movie, basically, if you've seen jackass or the CKY series, you'd know what to expect for humor, considering it has most of the people from those movies. Overall... i just had to give it a 10/10 because its one of my favorite movies of all time.<br /><br />~F0rs4k3n<br /><br />(P.S.) Haggard rules!; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: This is the kind of movie that you rent when you are incredibly tired, or impaired in some other way... The acting in this movie is so bad it seems intentional, and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there is one scene when the puppets are coming alive where you can see most of a hand holding the puppet, moving it about. The movie looked as if it was filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fistfight nearly erupted when my friends and I were calling each other names from this flick, that's how terrible it was. If you enjoy getting mad at movies, I recommend this to you, otherwise, flee as though your very life depended on it.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was the enriched uranium. Actually the script \"may\" have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors, but the dramatics of an aging Diane Lane acting as if she was a teenager (or even a twenty-something) was too much to stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into the arms of Richard Gere and then pull both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking, \"Oh, my aching back...this babe sure doesn't weight 125 lbs. anymore!\" Anyway, both characters were distinctly unlikeable, especially Richard Gere's: a self absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) that was on some kind of \"soul quest\" after a botched operation left him with a dead patient (an older woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry husband and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet said angry husband (at the husband's request) when he meets up with Adrienne. She is recently split from her unfaithful husband (shock) and is helping out a friend by watching her beach-front cottage rental. Of course, that's where Dr. Flanner ends up staying and they both end up falling MADLY in love (especially after she finds out he is a rich doctor AND a plastic surgeon). In between romantic interludes and a nauseating song/dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CD's?), they both try to figure how their lives got so totally screwed up. Dr. Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a Dr.) who resents him for not being there for him while he was growing up. (Naturally Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time rather than raising an impetuous, distracting boy.) To make a long (predictable) story short, Adrienne helps Dr. Flanner face his inner demons as well as confront said angry husband and son of the woman who died on his operating table (after going in for a \"routine\" cyst removal of the face). Dr. Flanner is FINALLY able to tell the husband (played excruciatingly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was all the fault of that danged anesthesiologist. \"I told him she was too old for that much juice!\" Glenn's character,(Robert Torrelson) appears to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive by this time that you wonder if if he is even hearing the good Dr. at all or thinking about some acreage that he needs to plow. Ever more circumspect, Dr. Flanner then decides he needs to visit his son (who is now practicing medicine pro-bono in a third world country) to mend their relationship. Unfortunately, that means he must temporarily bid adieu to Adrienne. Of course, while entertaining the natives in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour on the hour to Adrienne (who nearly swoons like a school girl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was to tell her goodbye. Evidently, apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife's death was the second hardest thing. In the end he gets killed in a freak mud slide (poetic justice as in mud pack?) and she is left with just the memories of what could have been...hopefully no more Gere/Lane sequels!; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: Johnny Knoxville has gone insane.<br /><br />In the first Jackass he delighted in practical jokes more so than the physical stuff  his opening car rental gag and the later bit involving an air horn on a golf course were more akin to some type of extreme Candid Camera  but in Jackass: Number Two he's really off his rocker.<br /><br />Beginning with a sequence where he is chased through a living room by a bull, or later when he rides a rocket (a stunt which almost cost him his life due to an unexpected explosion from the side of the rocket), and especially when he stands willfully in front of a defense mechanism and takes a spray of pellets to the stomach, Knoxville is a madman. In the first film Bam Margera and Steve-O  notorious party animals  were the daring ones, but you know it's pretty bad when you see Knoxville enticing them to do a stunt.<br /><br />This is essentially a series of stunts pulled off by guys consumed by testosterone, constantly trying to one-up each other. It will eventually end in death for one of the cast members  in Jackass 2 Steve-O nearly loses a leg to a shark, Knoxville (as aforementioned) is nearly impaled with an explosion from a rocket, and so on and so forth. Jackass 3 has already been confirmed owing to the success of 2, and frankly I can't imagine any stunt out-performing the bull run in the opening scene of this film  that's incredible footage. It's almost unbelievable, and I wondered whether it had been faked, but apparently it was 100% genuine. (Which is actually kind of frightening.) And in terms of extremes Jackass 2 far outdoes its predecessor  it also feels more cinematic than the first film, with less of the cheesy titles preceding stunts that were made famous on the original MTV television show.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the boys were given too much freedom here, and a good number of the gags are simply lame exercises in crudity  I can enjoy the occasional poop gag, but watching a man relieve himself on a miniature toilet, or see Steve-O take beer up the butt (yes, honestly), gets grating after a while. Even the frat boys in the screening I attended  who were enthusiastic when Wee Man took a playing card up the rear and got zapped by a rigged chair  were disgusted by some of the scenes in this film. It's not a matter of getting away with as much as possible  it's a matter of saying, \"Is this even entertaining or funny?\" Many times, sadly, it really isn't.<br /><br />But for every lame stunt involving fecal matter and farting on people's faces, there are some brilliant hidden-camera bits. Wacky director Spike Jonze (\"Adaptation\") dresses up as an old woman and hits the streets naked, with sagging breasts and no shame. And my personal favorite skit involved Knoxville as an irresponsible old man, out for lunch with his grandson, letting him drink alcohol and smoke and swear and insult people. That's classic comedy taken to new extremes with the liberties of an R-rating. It's a shame they had to ruin all the great stuff  including a final segment involving an elaborate terrorist prank  with poop jokes along the way.<br /><br />Still, there's enough sheer spirit and craziness in this film to merit a viewing, and it's really taken the concept of extremity in cinema to new heights.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",

Very well made film, very well cut, doesn't really get to the height that Human Traffic did, but it's a very good effort. Well directed, and I thought the lead actor put in a superb performance! In fact the only really bad performance in the film was from Tim Curry, who is supposed to be the name.<br /><br />Cool Film surprised it hasn't done better than it has. I'd never heard of it until I saw it at a mates.<br /><br />I'm not a raver, but I imagine people who are will really like this film.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n"

      "Review: This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, \"Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?\" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing.<br /><br />After that, though, its all a complete blank. I think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember ANYTHING from it. I understand that Leslie Nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw him in \"Spy Hard,\" in \"Scary Movie 4,\" and \"Police Squad 3\" and none of these were great movies, but I came away at least remembering *something*. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank.<br /><br />I find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary. The shear beauty and horror of one mans walk through life, are revealed in totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and connected through a mental maze that has been transformed into a single straight hallway which the walls have been plastered with images created by one mans characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords. This film, for about 80 minutes, have discovered a new dimension of storytelling. What do I call this apparently new sense. Only God knows, after all, isn't a MIRACLE something that God does for us, but chooses to remain ANONYMOUS?<br /><br />This is a requirement to see.

Sherman (producer) and Al Adamson (director) corral several actors they've worked with before, including Taylor, Adamsons' sexy wife Regina Carrol, Angelo Rossitto, Zandor Vorkov, and Vicki Volante. They tried to go for the feel of the previous \"Blood Island\" entries but one can tell this was made stateside. While not necessarily a \"good\" film, it's got a bunch of amusing elements to add up to an entertainingly trashy whole. A malevolent dwarf (Rossitto), gory operations, a rather unconvincing makeup job on Bloom, the political intrigue subplot, caverns full of cobwebs, etc. The narrative is actually pretty coherent, with plot twists thrown in here and there. I think it could have been trimmed a bit; some scenes drag. But it's got its fun moments and an ending people might not expect.<br /><br />For this kind of thing, the acting isn't too bad. Both Taylor and Rossitto are fun; the latter seems to be having quite a good time in his role. Volante is appealing enough, and Williams is O.K. in the heroic role. In any event, it's nice to see all of these familiar faces in one of these films.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing special, but as a trashy B \"horror\" (I use the word loosely, none of this is exactly scary) film, it certainly amuses.<br /><br />7/10; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: \"Love Life\" explores a very culturally relevant scenario of a marriage of convenience between a lesbian and a gay man. I found the subject matter compelling, even if the conflict was a bit forced and too easily resolved. For example, Thomas falls for Joe a little too quickly and conveniently for the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses...the one that got to me the most was the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene. In the end, I found myself more turned-on by this movie than moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows it all quite a few times with pornstar skill and exuberance, and all-too-often acting chops to match. Many times, the movie seems like it is going to go full-on porn. Stephanie Kirchen does a fine job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was sullied a bit for me, since I was in the mood for a good romp in the shower by the end of this movie.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: At the end, it is clear that the murderers planted the murder weapon in Mrs. Columbo's car and it was at the police ballistics lab. <br /><br />But where did the gun under the hood, used in the demonstration, come from? Wouldn't the murderers have cleared out the stuff under the hood? They had a whole week? Or did Columbo's cops replicate the camera/gun under the hood used in the demonstration? How did they do that without breaking and entering the car? Perhaps this is why the murders seemed surprised at the end. But how could Columbo have replicated their camera/gun device and gotten it calibrated to their key fob? Columbo must have gotten the gun back from ballistics and had it re-planted under the hood of the car, and been very lucky that the rest of the device with camera was still there and transmitting.<br /><br />This was a 10/10 show until this glaring plot error at the end.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n",
      "Review: Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie's nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this \"Smile\" is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.<br /><br />The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a TV-spawned Malibu family act out \"Gidget Get Birth Control.\" Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.<br /><br />The film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating Ling like the Frankenstein monster. Kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and Kramer's answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. Why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? We see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is Ling being equally as hot and popular as Katie.<br /><br />Funding for the film came from a trust established by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They envisioned a heritage of quality family films. Give me \"Son of Paleface\" any day.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: I am the sort of person who never, ever watches animated movies, but I make an exception for Thumbelina and the Swan Princess. Being absolutely in love with the first installment of the series, I bought this and sat down to watch it with a very biased mind, determined to love it because I'd spent money buying it. I finished the movie, and all I can think is THE HORROR!!! I wanted to like it, I really did. I tried very, VERY hard to like it. But I couldn't enjoy a second of this grueling film. The songs made me feel like ripping my ears out of my head. The dialogue was so lame I felt myself twitching with frustration and irritation every time someone opened his or her mouth. The villain was laughable and I felt myself wanting Derek and Odette to die in the end... and I was absolutely in love with them from the first film.<br /><br />I am going to try repress the memory of this movie, because it almost destroyed the first one for me. There is one song in the movie in which there are a series of flashbacks to the first film. The difference in animation between the two is made very obvious, and I began yearning for the first one and wishing I'd never set eyes on the third.<br /><br />Do yourself and favor and don't waste your time.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: It was definitely worth viewing, I don't regret that. But also it was kind of ordinary. Something, that I would expect from a movie titled like that. Love story was nice to watch. Humour was involved, but nothing surprised or spooked me. Shooting, \"tough guys\" etc. ain't worth it any more.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: I thought this series was going to be another fun, action series with some dynamic plots and great performances. I was wrong. While I like Jamie Denton, this show is hardly worth watching at all, unless you enjoy watching some people brutalized and the actions of the agents supposedly warranted under the theme of \"national security.\" The show is great propaganda for the current government, and spews out jingoism as though we talk that way every day. After a couple of episodes, it was boring the hell out of me, and I started watching reruns of House Invaders on BBCAmerica instead. Rather watch CSI and Without a Trace, without a doubt.; true label = 0, prediction = 1.\n",
      "Review: Extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The depiction of the fighting parties as faceless, superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to Orwell's 1984, even if Bergman thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war. That is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards Eva's and Jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered with lambencies before. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civic conventions.; true label = 1, prediction = 0.\n"
